			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="assets/images/Headshot.png" class="pr-3 img-fluid float-left" id="headshot">
			<p>I began my career as an engineer at Vanderbilt University. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering Science
				in 2015. Through my course work, I had to take 2 coding classes (Intro to Java and Matlab), but didn't really gain a
				passion for it until I was hired into my first position right out of college. In that position, I did a lot of in XML
				and transforming CSV files, along with some development in a specialized development tool for the software we implement.
				Through this, I learned I had a knact and passion for coding. From there I pursued some personal study until I joined
				the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp where I learned the skills necessary to be a Full Stack Developer. Currently, I am still
				a senior integrations lead for Alight Solutions who was the company that hired me right out of college, but now, I often
				make website and applications on the side for any who ask. A few fun facts about myself: I am a diehard Pittsburgh sports
				fan. Whether it's the Steelers, Penguins, or Pirates, I am always watching a game. I am also a diehard Vanderbilt sports
				fan. If we field a team in that sport, I watch it. As such, I spend most of my fall lamenting the woes of our football
				team.</p>
